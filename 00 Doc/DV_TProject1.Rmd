First We created a **.Rprofile.R ** document at the same level as our R script to run the needed packages. This document includes the packages required for the project.
Below is the path to the .Rprofile document, and shows the loaded packages:

```{r}
source("../.Rprofile.R", echo = FALSE)
``` 

**DATA VISUALIZATIONS**
The following visualizations were obtained from the following data:
```{r}
source("../01 Data/Superstore Sales.csv", echo = FALSE)
```
