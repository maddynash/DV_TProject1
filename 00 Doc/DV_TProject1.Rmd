First We created a **.Rprofile.R ** document at the same level as our R script to run the needed packages. This document includes the packages required for the project.
Below is the path to the .Rprofile document, and shows the loaded packages:

```{r}
source("../.Rprofile.R", echo = FALSE)
``` 

**DATA*
The data that was later manipulated using the Tableau workspace can be accessed:
```{r}
superstore <-read.csv("../01 Data/Superstore.csv")
``` 

##**DATA VISUALIZATIONS**

####**Customer Segment Sales per Product Category**

The first chart was generated using continuous (Sales) and categorial variables (Customer Segment and Product Category). We used this bar chart to visualize which segment was most popular regarding its sales. We can see that Corporate sales dominates and that small businesses have a small share of sales in comparison. We can also see that technology is the most popular product category and office supplies is the least popular category across all customer segments. We also wanted to determine which produt categories fell below the average sales that was calculated across all customer segments and product categories. The average, represented by a reference line was $745,994 in sales. We can see that the consumer and small business sales fall at or below this average sales calculation.

####**Regional Profits per Product Sub-Category**

This second visualization is a crosstab. A crosstab is generated by assigning two categorical varibles to the columns and rows. Here, product category and its sub-categories were assigned to rows while region was given to columns. We applied sum(profit) to the marks parameter in our tableau workbook. This shows the profits for each sub category in each region. With this we wanted to see which of the profits had the best profit margin. We applied a key performance indicator to assign the following categories to each profit value: "Good Profit Margin" with a profit margin of abover 20% , "Acceptable Profit Margin" with a profit margin between 20% and 5% and "Poor Profit Margin" with a profit margin of less than 5%. Looking at the results, office supplies and technology appear to be the most profitable across all regions. Additionally, furniture seems to have low profit margins with very few profits categorized as "Good Profit Margin". The office supplies product category appears to have the most varied profit margins across all regions.

####**Sales vs. Profit for each Region**

We created a scatter plot using two continuous variables, profit and sales, and assigned them to the colums and rows in our worksheet. We wanted to see which region had the highest correlation between profit and sales and which had the least. In the east there is an almost linear relationship between sales and profit. The south region on the other hand shows a poor correlation between profit and sales. In the west, it can be seen that there exists almost no linear relationship between sales and profit when profit is less than zero. When it is larger than zero the data points appear to show a somewhate positively linear relationship between sales and profit.
