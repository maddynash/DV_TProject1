This workshop is designed to introduce you to R and ggplot as well as RStudio, KnitR, Slidify, and Shiny.  \nR is a central piece of the Big Data Analytics Revolution, for example, see http://opensource.com/business/14/7/interview-david-smith-revolution-analytics for an article entitled \"Big data influencer on how R is paving the way\"**\n\n###This is how my RStudio is configured:\n```{r}\nsessionInfo()\n```\n\nYou also need to install LaTeX if you want to generate PDF files from KnitR.  \n\n![](./LaTex.png) http://latex-project.org/ftp.html\n\n###Getting Started - Clone the RWorkshop GiT Repository:\n\nUse a GUI tool like SourceTree to clone the repository or execute the following commands in a terminal window:\n\n**Phils-MacBook-Pro:Mine pcannata$ pwd**  \n/Users/pcannata  \n**Phils-MacBook-Pro:~ pcannata$ git clone https://github.com/pcannata/DataVisualization.git**  \nCloning into 'DataVisualization'...\nremote: Counting objects: 74, done.\nremote: Compressing objects: 100% (60/60), done.\nremote: Total 74 (delta 6), reused 67 (delta 4)\nUnpacking objects: 100% (74/74), done.\nChecking connectivity... done.  \n**Phils-MacBook-Pro:~ pcannata$ ls -a DataVisualization/**  \n.  \t..\t\t.git\t\tREADME.md\tRWorkshop\n\n###Getting Started - Create a New RStudio Project for the code in the cloned repository:\n\n![](./NewProject.png)  \n\n![](./NewProject2.png)  \n\n![](./NewProject3.png)  \n\n![](./NewProject4.png)    \n\n###Getting Started - Create a .Rprofile file to load libraries when the project is started: \n\nCreate an new file text named .Rprofile.\n\nPut the following into .Rprofile  \nrequire(\"ggplot2\") \nrequire(\"ggthemes\") \nrequire(\"gplots\") \nrequire(\"grid\") \nrequire(\"RCurl\") \nrequire(\"reshape2\") \nrequire(\"rstudio\") \nrequire(\"tableplot\") \nrequire(\"tidyr\") \nrequire(\"dplyr\") \nrequire(\"jsonlite\") \nrequire(\"extrafont\") \nrequire(\"lubridate\")  \n\n##Be sure to put a newline after the last require statement. \n\n###Recommended Books:\n\n![](./RforEveryone.jpeg) ![](./RRR.png)  \nhttp://www.amazon.com/Everyone-Advanced-Analytics-Graphics-Addison-Wesley/dp/0321888030/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1404611818&sr=8-1&keywords=R+for+everyone \n\n###00 KnitR Overview\n**KnitR is an R package designed to generate dynamic reports using a mix of the R, LaTex, and the Rmarkdown (see http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/?version=0.98.945&mode=desktop) languages.**  \n\nSee also http://yihui.name/knitr/ and http://kbroman.github.io/knitr_knutshell/\n\n**Simple examples can be found in \"04 KnitR/doc1.Rmd\" and \"04 KnitR/doc2.Rmd\". These can generate html, pdf, and word documents. The output from Kniting doc2.Rmd is,**  \n\n![](./KnitR.png) \n\n####A comprehensive KnitR example (which generated this document) can be found in \"00 Doc/RWorkshop.Rmd\".  \n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Reproducible-Research-Studio-Edition-Chapman/dp/1498715370/ref=dp_ob_title_bk \n\n###00 High Level Overview - Creating an Excel-like Chart in R - see the 00 Overview Folder in the DrCannata/Rworkshop Repository  \n\nThis is something that is easily done in Excel: \n\n![](./ExcelChart.png) \n\nHow would you do the same thing in R? \n\n```{r}\nsource(\"../00 Overview/Overview.R\", echo = TRUE)\n```\n\nSee also http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-devel/R-lang.html, http://www.r-tutor.com/r-introduction, and http://www.cookbook-r.com/\n\n###01 R Dataframes - see the 02 R Dataframes Folder in the DrCannata/Rworkshop Repository  \n\n**A data frame is used for storing data tables. It is a list of vectors of equal length. For example, the following variable df is a data frame containing three vectors n, s, b.**\n\n```{r}\nn = c(2, 3, 5) \ns = c(\"aa\", \"bb\", \"cc\") \nb = c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE) \ndf = data.frame(n, s, b)       # df is a data frame\nhead(df)\n``` \n\nDataframes can be loaded from databases, CSVs, Excel, etc.. Loading dataframes from an Oracle database will be discussed later in this Workshop.\n\nSee also http://www.r-tutor.com/r-introduction/data-frame\n\nMany R packages come with demo dataframes. The ggplot package comes with a demo dataframe called diamonds which we will use for this workshop.\n\n```{r}\nsource(\"../01 R Dataframes/Dataframes.R\", echo = TRUE)\n```\nFor more on subsetting dataframes see http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/r/faq/subset_R.htm\n\n###02 RESTful Data Access\n\n```{r}\nsource(\"../02 RESTful Data Access/Access Oracle Database.R\", echo = TRUE)\n```\n\n###03 Grammar of Graphics with R & ggplot2\n**ggplot is an R package for data exploration and visualization. It produces production quality graphics and allows you to slice and dice your data in many different ways. ggplot uses a general scheme for data visualization which breaks graphs up into semantic components such as scales and layers. In contrast to other graphics packages, ggplot2 allows the user to add, remove or alter components in a plot at a high level of abstraction.**\n\nSee also http://ggplot2.org/, http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/ggplot2.pdf, and https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ggplot2 \n\n###Grammar of Graphics \n\nplot ::= [coord](http://sape.inf.usi.ch/quick-reference/ggplot2/coord)  [scale+](http://sape.inf.usi.ch/quick-reference/ggplot2/scale) [facet?](http://sape.inf.usi.ch/quick-reference/ggplot2/facet)   [label?](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ggplot2-cheatsheet.pdf)  [theme?](http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/theme.html) layer+  \nlayer ::= data [mapping](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~cannata/dataVis/R%20Cheat%20Sheets/aes.txt) [stat](http://sape.inf.usi.ch/quick-reference/ggplot2/stat) [geom](http://sape.inf.usi.ch/quick-reference/ggplot2/geom) [position?](http://sape.inf.usi.ch/quick-reference/ggplot2/position)  \n\n```{r}\nsource(\"../03 Grammar of Graphics with R & ggplot2/Grammar Examples.R\", echo = TRUE)\n```\n\n**The Chapter 7 of \"R for Everyone\" has many more examples of ggplots.**\n\n###ggplot2 and functions\n\n```{r}\n# source(\"../03 Grammar of Graphics with R & ggplot2/plotFunction.R\", echo = TRUE)\n```\n\n**You should now be able to open RWorkshop/00 Doc/4diamonds.png. It should look like the following plot.**\n\n![](./4diamonds.png) \n\n###slidify\n**You can use Slidify to generate HTML slide decks using only the Rmarkdown language.**  \n\nSee also http://slidify.org and http://slidify.org/start.html\n\n**Follow the instructions in \"05 Slidify/slidify setup.R\" to install and run slidify. You should be able to produce a slide deck with a first slide that looks something like the following.** \n\n![](./slidify.png)  \n\n**Cool trick - Any github repo with a branch called gh-pages will get served as a website. If the content of that repo is the stuff of websites (html,css), then you get free web hosting. So, create a branch called gh-pages and push to it.**  \n\n###shiny\n**The shiny R package allows you to build interactive web-based applications using only R with no knowledge of html, css, or javascript needed. You just need to write two scripts (see the example files in the 06Shiny directory):**  \n\n* ui.R : Defines the layout and the interactive elements that the user can access.  \n* server.R : Defines what computations are done in response to user interactions. \n\nSee also http://shiny.rstudio.com and http://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial \n\nTo run the shiny app that's in the 06Shiny directory run the following in the main RWorkshop directory (make sure the working directory is set to this directory):  \nlibrary(shiny)  \nrunApp(\"06Shiny\")   # Make sure there are no spaces in the string argument to runAPP\n\nThis should pop the application up in a browser, you can also access it in a browser at http://127.0.0.1:6837. It should look like the following.\n\n![](./shiny.png) \n\n###shinyapps\n\nThe example above ran the shiny app on your local machine, but to share with others, you have to send around the R files and the user needs to have R and know a little bit about it.\n\nInstead, you can remotely host shiny apps and then just send people links. Get a free account at shinyapps.io/signup.html and give it a try.\n\n![](./shinyapps.io.png)\n\n![](./pcannata.shinyapps.io.png)\n\n**library(\"devtools\", lib.loc=\"/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.0/Resources/library\")  \ninstall_github( repo = \"shinyapps\", username=\"rstudio\" )  \nshinyapps::setAccountInfo(name='pcannata', token='3ECF447A741004F6A8B7208C9ED778E1', secret='. . .
